 Statement: You have to design a generic calculator that
takes as input an expression and evaluates as outputs
the answer.
Use self implemented generic stack. No STL
allowed.
Terminology: Generic stack= A single expression can
contain both int,double and the answer should be
accordingly.
Example: 1. Input : (4+5)/6*3 Output : 4.5
 2. Input: (4+5.6)/3.2+(4+3.888) Output: 10.888
 
 Input format for this question:
Just read a single string from stdin.
Output format for this question:
Output a single double value representing the answer after evaluating the input string.
